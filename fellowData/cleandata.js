Some things I enjoy doing are puzzles, yoga, and watching movies. I think having a work-life balance is incredibly important, so I love that the TRAC program sees mental health and mindfulness as a priority!",ajk324@lehigh.edu

One of my favorite parts of the TRAC program is that it has allowed me to create new connections and friends with people in the Lehigh community I would not have come across in my normal schedule.",frh223@lehigh.edu

A fun fact about me is that I have a younger brother and that I am allergic to peanuts. A TV show I recommend is ""Glee"" because it is my favorite show and the music is incredible. I decided to join TRAC to immerse myself in a community of hard-working, talented, and passionate individuals! ",gek224@lehigh.edu
