I'm a senior at Lehigh University interested in visual storytelling through journalism and documentary film. When I'm not writing or making videos, I  enjoy playing on the Ultimate Frisbee Team, being a Diversity Peer Educator, reading books, and of course, being a TRAC Fellow. One fun fact about me is that I can take sunglasses off my face with my feet. ",jbp223@lehigh.edu
