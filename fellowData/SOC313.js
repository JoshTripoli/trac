I have been extremely dedicated to writing since a young age and find it to be a core part of my everyday life. I hope to use my passion of the written and spoken word as a journalist, poet, speechwriter, politician, or wherever else I end up channeling my energy. I spend most of my time in The Brown and White newsroom, on the tennis court, binge-watching bad comedies, attempting to bake as much as possible, and always drinking Saxbys coffee. I am always happy and eager to talk to new people, so please feel free to reach out!",skb324@lehigh.edu123318382,"SOC313 FELLOW 2",she/her,123318382,"Houston, TX",2024,spring,3,Music,"Hello! My name is Jay Piazza and I’m a junior majoring in psychology. I’m originally from Sacramento county and was drawn to Chico State because of its beautiful campus and surrounding landscape. I enjoy writing and building on my skills every year through various term papers, especially those that relate to psychology. In my free time I enjoy watching movies, playing video games, and cooking. I look forward to working with students and helping them improve and gain confidence in their writing skills!"
