I'm also a huge Carolina Hurricanes fan, and my favorite novel is The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K. Le Guin.

This is my 4th year as a TRAC Fellow and it has been one of my most rewarding experiences at Lehigh. During the past few years, I have worked with the Sociology and Business Communications classes as well as working as a Fellow while studying abroad in Florence. Currently, I am working as a Niche Fellow with the TRAC 100 seminar and am assisting our Associate Fellows as they complete their Self-Design projects. I love the work that we do in TRAC and I wish every student at Lehigh could work with a Fellow at some point in their education.",krm422@lehigh.edu
