ajk324,"Pre-Professional","Ashley Kim",she/her,"Wood Ridge, NJ",2024,"International Relations and Economics, Asian Studies","I am passionate about the TRAC program because it provides me with the opportunity to connect with other Lehigh students and to help students navigate the writing process. Some things I enjoy doing are puzzles, yoga, and watching movies. I think having a work-life balance is incredibly important, so I love that the TRAC program sees mental health and mindfulness as a priority!",ajk324@lehigh.edu
