            <h1>Who are the TRAC Writing Fellows?</h1>
            <p>Talented undergraduate students from across the disciplines, recruited through a highly competitive selection process and trained in a rigorous 4-credit seminar to work with faculty and their students on writing, research, and the use of technology. The selection process generally starts with a faculty nomination followed by an application procedure that includes writing samples, a transcript, and interviews.</p>
            <h1>What is TRAC?</h1>
            <p>The fellows are assigned to selected courses across the disciplines to work with faculty and their students over the duration of the entire semester. They consult with faculty about their writing assignments, put comments on student drafts of writing-in-progress, and hold individual draft conferences with students. They also provide guidance on the research process and can help with the use of technology. Fellows do not grade student papers, nor do they play any other role in determining grades. They are required to attend regularly scheduled staff meetings and workshops, and participate in program assessment activities.</p>
            <h1>What training do TRAC Fellows receive?</h1>
            <p>The Fellows are trained in the TRAC Fellows Seminar, a team-taught course (the Director of Writing Across the Curriculum, the Director of Faculty Development, a Research Librarian, an Instructional Technologist, and various expert guest lecturers). Designed as a graduate-level type seminar, the course emphasizes the writing and research process, including an intensive study of current literature in the field of composition and rhetoric, and practical, hands-on approaches to the teaching of writing with special emphases on effective written feedback and peer conferences.</p>
            <h1>What are the benefits of the program for Fellows?</h1>
            <p>The fellows are members of a select and talented group of undergraduates working as part of the Lehigh Lab in partnership with university faculty. The experience of peer tutoring develops skills in writing, teaching, collaboration, communication, and leadership. Additionally, the experience of working throughout their undergraduate years with professors in their discipline provides a rare opportunity for fellows to enhance and reinforce discipline-specific knowledge and skills. Additionally, TRAC Fellows are compensated with a stipend, on a semester basis, paid monthly.</p>
            <h1>Benefits for Faculty</h1>
            <p>Faculty who work with TRAC Fellows will see an improvement in student writing and enjoy reading better student work without having to devote precious time to reading and providing feedback on working drafts. In the TRAC Fellows, faculty will also have a valuable resource for helping students understand the purpose of writing assignments and helping student with projects that require library and database research. TRAC Fellows are trained in assisting faculty with integrating “write-to-learn” activities that enhance student engagement with course content. Additionally, as part of the Center for Innovation in Teaching and Learning, TRAC Fellows work together with LTS instructional technologists to provide assistance in making the best and most appropriate use of new educational technologies. Ultimately, faculty will benefit from having students in their courses who are increasingly engaged, knowledgeable, and communicative.</p>
